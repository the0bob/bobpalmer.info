{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Bob Palmer","description":"Software Developer from a small town in Kansas. I make widgets, apis, games, and whatever else the bills paid or holds my interest. I like to make the bleep bloop box do things with less clicks, tell the user they did good, then give them a treat like a sound or animation or something in exchange for their sweet, sweet data. I also evaluate all of the components of the application concept and classify them by their importance, allocating resources and time based on the 80/20 principle on both the front end and back end to deliver the most optimized product possible using said allocated resources. Or something. I'm currently sharpening my JavaScript, C#, Java, Unity, React, SpringBoot, Bootstrap, UX, UI, Postgres, SQL, Graphic Design, Project Management, and other skills on a semi-daily basis because I like getting good at things. Keep It Simple, Stupid. I have ADHD and I don't medicate, so I just kinda... ride that wave and see where it takes me. If you're not cool with that, let's not do business.","author":"the0bob"}}}}
